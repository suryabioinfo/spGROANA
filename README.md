Delta-Z Analysis for Peptide–Membrane Systems This Python script performs batch Δz analysis between peptide COM and lipid headgroup COM from GROMACS .xvg files. It quantifies membrane penetration metrics (interface/core fractions, crossings) and classifies peptides as CPP-like or non-CPP. Results are automatically summarized into a CSV file for downstream analysis.
